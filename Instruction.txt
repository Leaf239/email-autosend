제목 (subject) : Heartfelt Request to Restore Minecraft Earth from a Dedicated Minecraft Fan

내용 (body) : 

Dear Mojang Team,

I’m writing to you as a devoted fan of Minecraft and someone who truly misses Minecraft Earth. I understand that managing a game like this during the challenges of the past few years may have been incredibly difficult, but I—and many others in the community—feel that Minecraft Earth brought something special to the world of gaming that we haven’t experienced elsewhere. It was more than just another game; it was a way to blend our favorite virtual world with the real one, and I hope you’ll consider what it would mean to bring it back.

Minecraft Earth was a rare chance to experience the creativity and adventure of Minecraft in real life, connecting with friends and the community in a completely unique way. From building structures together in parks to discovering resources in our neighborhoods, it was unlike anything else. Games like Pokémon Go still show how impactful these real-world experiences can be, and I believe Minecraft has an equally, if not even greater, potential to thrive in this space. Letting Minecraft Earth go feels like a missed opportunity to explore this innovative path.

There’s also the significant time, talent, and investment poured into Minecraft Earth by the developers. The features, the AR integration, and the creative mechanics—it’s clear that so much was carefully designed to capture Minecraft’s spirit. Ending it so early almost feels like all that hard work, from both Mojang and the players who invested in it, was lost. Bringing Minecraft Earth back would breathe life into that effort again, building on what was already such a strong foundation.

Most importantly, I believe Minecraft Earth helped bring people together. It created real-world interactions, encouraging people to make memories outside, explore, and share in the joys of Minecraft in ways we simply can’t do from behind a screen. It fostered a sense of community that many of us miss dearly. I’m sure that if Minecraft Earth returned, it would rekindle that same spirit and be met with incredible enthusiasm from fans around the world.

So, I ask you, from one Minecraft fan to another, please consider restoring Minecraft Earth. I know that many of us would cherish the chance to experience that world again.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I trust that, whatever decision is made, you’ll keep the voice of the community in mind.

Warm regards,  
Minecraft Earth Big Fan
